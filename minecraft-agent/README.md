# Minecraft OpenPsi Agent

An embodied cognitive agent for Minecraft, powered by OpenPsi and MeTTa.

## Overview

This use-case connects OpenPsi's cognitive architecture to Minecraft via Vereya, enabling an agent whose behavior **emerges from internal needs** (hunger, safety, curiosity) rather than scripted logic.
